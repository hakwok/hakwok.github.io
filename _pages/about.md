I am a third-year student at the University of California, San Diego, pursuing my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. My research interests lie within the intersection of Artificial Intelligence with audio processing and musical transcription. I specialize in harnessing big data, recommender systems, and natural language processing to transform products and software with machine learning.

I am actively pursuing internship opportunities in Machine Learning and Software Engineering, eager to showcase my skills and gain insights into industry-standard practices. Down the line, my goal is to transition into a Product Management role, aligning with my deep-seated interest in advancing data-driven technology and leveraging my innate abilities in external communication and leadership.
# Selected Experience

## Research
Here is the project proposal writeup: [Image View Synthesis and Differentiable Rendering in Slang](https://sudo-boris.github.io/portfolio/RCPPO/)

## Professional Experiencee
I have experience with independent research. I have implemented the Reward Constrained Policy Optimization paper into stable-baselines3 PPO and reproduced the original results by running and tracking experiments.

To accompany this work, I have submitted a blog post to the **ICLR** Blogposts Track communicating the paper's theory and my results.

Feel free to look at my specific [portfolio entry](https://sudo-boris.github.io/portfolio/RCPPO/).

## Projects & Initatives
Currently I am working as a **Student Researcher** at the Reliable Multimodal AI Lab at the TU Darmstadt under the supervision of Prof. Marcus Rohrbach working on **Generative Video-Language Modelling**.
Additionally, I have professional experience working as an **Applied Machine Learning Student Researcher** at the Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute. 

## Other Interests and Qualifications
Currently, I'm on the path to obtaining my California Real Estate Salesperson license, driven by my commitment to thrive in our family business. Outside of real estate, I hold certification as a USATF Official and have a background as a sprinter in club-college athletics. Additionally, I've contributed to my high school alma mater as both a Defensive Backs and Linebackers coach. My interests extend to music, where I've earned an Associate of the Royal Schools of Music Piano Diploma and have actively collaborated with producers as an audio engineer.
